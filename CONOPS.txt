The objective of the program is to take a string and convert it into an md5hash in C.
The Goal is to be able to use any string, regardless of length and still find a correct hash.

MD5 works first by taking a string, and converting it into a "message" of length 512 bits. 
This is done by taking each character's ASCII integer value, and appending it to an array of integers. At the end, we appenx a 1 bit, then pad 0s until we reach 448bits.
the final 64 bits are used for storing the number of bits the string is.
The key is that if the string size(number of bits) surpasses 448bits, a second block of 512 bits is created. 
Each block of the message is divided into 16 parts. 
Then, we take initiation vectors A, B, C, D.
We do 4 rounds of 16 operations using these vectors which will change their values, where each round has a different function.
At the end, we add the first values of the vectors back to themselves, and if there are more than 1 blocks, repeat.
At the end, we recieve the MD5 hash thru the 4 vectors.
